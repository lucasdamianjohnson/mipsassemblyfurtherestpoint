# mipsassemblyfurtherestpoint
MIPS Assembly furtherest point program. 
I made this program while taking a class at Michigan Tech. It is written in MIPS assembly. 

This programs reads in x and y points then determines which one is farthest from the orgin (0,0)after (0,0) is entered in. 


In the respirtory I also included a program to compile the code. You can also get it below:

From their webiste: "MARS is a lightweight interactive development environment (IDE) for programming in MIPS assembly language"
It's just a jar file so if you have java installed installed you should be able to run it.
